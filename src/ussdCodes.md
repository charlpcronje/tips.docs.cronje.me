# USSD Codes for Android

## Standard Android secret codes on Samsung Galaxy J1 mini prime phone

These Samsung Galaxy J1 mini prime secret codes can be typed in the dial pad on the phone application and will directly trigger a specific function to run.

There's a lot of statistics and reports that are created by the phone, but are not necessarily directly displayed on the Android user interface - however, these cheat codes can bring these codes up.

## Hidden Samsung Galaxy J1 mini prime phone menu

Some lucky phones, depending on their Android and manufacturer software version, have access to an hidden Android phone menu, which is called the System UI Tuner.

This function has been removed in latest Android versions, and can only be accessed via an app. However, if your phone still uses an old version, you can display the hidden System UI Tuner that shows hidden and upcoming features with these tricks.

## System UI Tuner activation

- Start by pulling down the settings menu from your phone
- Top on the `Gear Icon` (the one from settings) and `hold` your tap a few seconds until it spins
- If it does `not spin`, it means that your phone is too recent - see below which app to use instead
- If it does spin, after a few seconds it will show a message Congrats! System UI Tuner has been added to Settings
- You can now open a new menu with a wrench icon close to the mobile screen gear icon
- The System UI Tuner can now be accessed from the `Settings` > `System menu`

## Software hidden codes

Some hidden Samsung Galaxy J1 mini prime cheat codes are there to deliver information about your phone software, provided that they are available on your phone's version and that you enter the right code.

Most of the Android secret have been created to help developers quickly access some valuable information about the phone to ease the creation process, and might not work on your phone version, due to various updates, or might be dangerous - therefore, use them with caution!
