# Custom Scripts

Some repetitive tasks just get to me after a while, then remebering all the Docker containers names can be hard sometimes. So to manage some of these type of things I created a few scripts.

- [Global Scripts](globalScripts.md)
- [sevice-menu (sm)](serviceMenu.md)
- [Retype Build](retypeBuild.md)
- [Python Set Version](pythonSetVersion.md)
- [Set Permissions Web (Prod)](fixWebPermisions.md)
- [Set Permissions 4 Web (Test)](set4web.md)
- [Foam Starter Template](foamStarter.md)
