# Sign Documents Online 

This is not so much a Linux or Dev tip but just something handy to know. I regularly find myself in position where I have to sign documents. This is always a pain in the neck. Most of the online services will let you go trough all the effort of signing your documents just to let you make a payment in the end or go through a lengthy registration process.

Recently I discovored [https://www.digisigner.com](https://www.digisigner.com/free-electronic-signature/sign-document-online). Here you can simply upload your document, sign it and download again.

No registration required
